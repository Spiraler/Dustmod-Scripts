# Dustmod Scripts
This is where I upload all the scripts I make for dustmod levels. Some of them were just made for a single level and are usually named something similar to the level they were made for.

## General Use Scripts
[no_spread](no_spread.as) - This script removes all dustspread in the level.

[SeedGenerator](SeedGenerator.as) - This script allows for the creation of a random seed at the start of a level based on the system clock and saves it in the level using entity resyncs to recalculate the seed later. This allows for the creation of levels with random elements that are different every time such that replays still work.
